# 25 Days JS Challenge

This repository contains my solutions and notes for the "25 Days JS Challenge" inspired by Hitesh Choudhary's course. The goal is to revisit core JavaScript concepts, practice focused exercises each day.

Repository goals
- Recreate and practise 25 small JavaScript lessons/exercises (one per day).
- Keep each day's code, notes and small examples self-contained in a `Day X/` folder.
- Maintain a simple progress tracker so it's easy to see what's done.


Progress tracker

Use the table below to track progress. Mark each day as ✅ when complete and include a short note or link to the file.
